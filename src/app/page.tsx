        <p>
          After 16 years in the banking industry, I am now pursuing my passion
          for technology by transitioning into full stack development. I have a
          strong background in problem-solving, customer service, and project
          management, which I am now applying to software development.
          Currently, I am enhancing my skills in JavaScript, React, and MongoDB
          through a coding boot camp. My goal is to build intuitive and
          efficient web applications that provide excellent user experiences. I
          am eager to contribute to dynamic tech teams and continue learning and
          growing in this field. I look forward to connecting with fellow tech
          enthusiasts, developers, and companies to explore opportunities and
          collaborations in full stack development.
